##ref_lon
#central meridian to compute UTM coordinates: This parameter is necessary because UTM coordinates are generally confined within a single UTM zone. If your study area crosses two different UTM zones, it would be complicated to convert to the UTM coordinates at the UTM zone boundary directly. So we shift the central meridian to the west (ref_lon), so that you could define a broader UTM zone than the common one. Usualy choose a ref_lon <= lonc.
