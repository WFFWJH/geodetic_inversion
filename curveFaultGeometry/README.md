This directory saves functions that are used to build the curved fault
geometry. The vertex of each triangle is defined following a geometric 
progression along depth. Each vertex is ensured along the curved fault
plane.


fit_curved_plane.m: use dense point source distribution to fit the surface
trace almost exactly and seismicity approximately.

Input: digitized surface trace + deeper seismicity
Output: meshed point sources that appromiate the curve fault plane



main_interpolate.m: use triangles to interpolate derived point source
distribution. We allow a depth-dependent triangular distribution.
